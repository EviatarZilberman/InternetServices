using keyword:
1. Used to call directuve links- shorting the writing when calling a class etc.
2. Used to use classes that implements the IDisposable interface. That interface is used to close connections to unmanaged resources, like db, files etc.
When using the 'using' keyword it calls the Dispose() method automatically when in the end of the process.
When the using is used like this: using () {} the Dispose() method is called in the end of the {}.

virtual keyword:
Allows to override the base function  or property in a derived class, by using the keyword override in the name of the overriding method.

as and is operators:
is- Used to perform checikng for reference types (i is int).
as- Used to perform conversion between competible reference types (var a = "aaa" string b = a as string).

Boxing / Unboxing:
Mechanisms used to convert between value types and reference types (must be used carefully because it can occur runtime exceptions):

Boxing (stored in the heap):
int num = 123;           // Value type (int)
object obj = num;        // Boxing: int is converted to object

Unboxing (stored in the stack):
object obj = 123;        // Boxing
int num = (int)obj;      // Unboxing: object is converted back to int

Boxing and unboxing can cause performance overhead because:

Boxing allocates memory on the heap, which is slower compared to the stack.
Unboxing involves casting and may result in runtime exceptions if not done carefully.
